A kassiski test attack for vigenere cipher as menioned in the text book is implemented. For the the assumptions as in the text were made. In the case where a monogramic statistical attack wasn't enough a BruteForce method was implemented on top of that to get the final output

    1. All the input should be given without including any of the special characters or new lines or even whitespace. The input must be given all in small letters. 
    2. Input message should be given in the input file as "message = <input message value>" -- lower case string
    3. The output will be a list of possible solutions (since a single monogram statistical attack was not sufficient to decipher a bruteforce method was used)

*Note: use space characters after and before "=" in input as given in the file
