A knownPT attack for HILL cipher as menioned in the text book is implemented. For the the assumptions as in the text were made. That is the key matrix dimension and a pair of plain text as well as the corresponding cipher text is also needed for the challenger. 

    1. All the input should be given without including any of the special characters or new lines or even whitespace. The input must be given all in small letters. 
    2. Input key dimension should be given in the input file as "key_dimension = <input key dimension value>"
    3. The known Plain tesxt should be given as "known PT = <input value of chosen PT>"
    4. The cipher texts corresponding to that plaintext should be given as "cipherText = <input value for the corresponding cipher text>" in caps 
    5. The output will be showing the Key matrix in Z26

*Note: use space characters after and before "=" in input as given in the file
*Note: the input should be a valid PT and it's corresponding CT for the alogorithm to work
